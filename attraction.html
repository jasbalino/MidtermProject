                        <p>Dingras is only a 30-minute drive from the capital of Ilocos Norte. Along the way, you will be greeted with vast fields that generously gift our people with bountiful crops. Rice, as a filipino staple food, is the main product here alongside a feast of different locally grown vegetables. Farming has not only become an occupation but has served as bond between families, clans, and comrades.</p>

                        <p>The Madongan Dam has catapulted Dingras to fame as it is one of the favorite summer or holiday getaways in the province because of the relaxing, invigorating and breathtaking experience one gets from its magnificent curtain falls. But for Dingrenios, there is more to
                                that fame.</p>
                        <p>This dam serves as one of the main water resources supplying the terrains, and with this blessing, Dingras remains formidable as the top rice-producing municipality in the province.Your
                                adventure would never be complete without a 20- to 30- minute trek to the majestic Dan-aw Falls located at Brgy. San Francisco. Here, you may want to commune with nature, as your feet tread
                                on the rocky pathway.
                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from that Dingras is also home to well-preserved centuries-old Spanish edifices that serve as indelible reminders of it’s rich history. These houses are a symbol of our ancestors’ gallantry,
                                simple living, and hardwork and these are what makes our future as bright as we imagine it to be. Dingras, the best is yet come!
