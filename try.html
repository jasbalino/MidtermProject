                    <h2>Who Finds Dingras</h2>
                    <p>When Capt. Juan De Salcedo was going north in his expedition, he stopped at Laoag. He found the natives wearing necklace, bracelets and trinkets of gold. He also found gold dust among their articles of trade. This surprised the Captain, so he inquired about the source of their wealth. He was told that some 20 kilometers east of Laoag, there was region where gold was as abundant as the leaves of the tress. The news interest the captain, but history failed to record whether or not Salcedo reached the region. The other people heard the news were to find that there was a little or no truth about the reports. Instead of tracing Salcedo’s steps, they paid their attention to the inviting plains and its rivers.
                
                    They cut the big tress and cleared the wide plains, and began to build crude homes and till the soil, planting crops like rice, corn and camote. Soon some intelligent people came to settle. More lands were cleared and much wider areas were cultivated until it became a prosperous settlement.</p>

                    <h2>Origin of its Name</h2>
                    <p>As in other communities, the town of Dingras has an interesting legend as to how its name evolved.  The legend, as handed down from generation to generation, was classically romantic, a gallant heir – warrior fighting for a lady’s love.
                
                    In the early times, there were two prosperous barangays in the present site of the town each one ruled by a powerful chief or datu.  They were bitter and mortal enemies.  Naslag was the powerful chief of the barangay north of the river while Allawigan was the chief of the south of the river.  One day, Allawigan and his warriors went to hunt.  Ras, his son, was the bravest among them.  During the hunt, Ras followed the deer, which went north across the river.  While he was watching the fleeing deer, he saw a beautiful damsel gathering wild flowers on the opposite side of the riverbank. She was Ding, the daughter of Naslag.  To help the lady, Ras gathered the most beautiful flowers near him; put them at the head of his arrow and shoot near the lady’s feet.  Ding looked at the other side of the river and waved her hands.  Ras went home happily.
                            
                    Ras begged his father for permission to win Ding for his wife.  But because the fathers of Ding and Ras were bitter enemies, the only way he could win her was in the open battle fiercely fought between the two tribes.  Ras led his father’s warriors.  They fought valiant and came out victorious in the end.  Ras asked for Ding as a prize but Naslag refused.  This angered him and hurled a challenge to the bravest warrior of Naslag in single combat with Ding as prize.  The challenge was accepted.  The combat was fought, and again, Ras was victorious.  He brought Ding triumphantly to Allawigan, his father.  Thereafter, the people named the two barangays Dingras, after Ras, their valiant warrior ruler, and Ding, his beautiful wife.</p>
